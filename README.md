KeepAware-old
=============

Windows Process Monitor for Node.js

I made this in a weekend when Node.js was first released for Windows as v0.5

Its a C# project that runs node as a Windows Service.

It logs all 'console.log' entries to the Windows Event Log, and automatically restarts the service when a js file is changed (similar to nodemon)

I renamed it '-old', since it is now obsolete, and want to use the KeepAware name for anothe project.
